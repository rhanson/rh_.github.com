*What is a data scientist?*
---------------------------
This term has been thrown around alot lately. Being a student of informatics I understand a data scientist to be someone who can look through tons of data and determine proper statistics that can provide insight into making good business decisions. Companies are always looking for the newest trends and consumer traits that will give thier business the competitive edge it needs, whether it be altering the business strategy or marketing in a different way to their potential clients. Ulitamely a data scientist is someone that is highly involved in showing a business the right direction to head towards. 

*Useful abilities*
-------------------
+ Programming
+ High level background of statistics
+ Ability to make informed decisions based on the numbers. 
+ Some public speaking (have to be able to convey the data to the higherups!)
And lot's more...
