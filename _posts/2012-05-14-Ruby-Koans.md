Learning Ruby with Ruby Koans:
-------------------------------
After joining the business HealPay I needed to learn the Ruby language. The way I began this was with Ruby koans. Basicaly these are a way to learn while doing excersizes in ruby that also provides a way to check your work to see what you did right and wrong. There are about 40 or so koans and what is interesting is that once you make your way through a couple of the introductory excersizes they give you sipmle projects for you to complete along the way so that you will be able to apply what you are learning to see if you can't figure out some simple problems. Again, they also provide you a way to check to see what you are doing right and wrong to somewhat guide you through your learning experience. It really is a hands on way of learning how to work in Ruby. I downloanded ruby version 1.9.3 and then I downloaded the koans form [rubykoans](http://rubykoans.com) and went to work. 

Aftermath
----------
I now can say I have a way better understanding of the syntax and I now am more able to read the code behind our business strategy. I come from a Python and Java background but I must say I enjoyed learning Ruby the most because of these self-paced excersices. Ruby Koans is a great way to start learning ruby and concrete your wisdom of the syntax.
